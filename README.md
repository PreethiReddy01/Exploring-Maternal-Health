Exploring Maternal Well-being: A Proposed Model for Comprehensive Statistical Analysis of Predictors for Suicide Attempts Among Postnatal Mothers.

**Aim:** The primary aim of our research is to identify and understand the multifaceted factors that contribute to the heightened risk of suicide attempts among postnatal mothers. By integrating advanced statistical models and machine learning algorithms, through this study, we sought to develop a predictive model that can accurately forecast the likelihood of suicide attempts based on various psychological, behavioral, and demographic indicators. This model is intended to serve as a tool for healthcare providers to initiate early interventions and support systems tailored to the needs of new mothers experiencing postnatal depression.
**Purpose:** The purpose of our study extends beyond academic inquiry; it is fundamentally about enhancing maternal mental health care. The project aims to provide healthcare professionals with a practical tool for early risk identification and intervention by developing a predictive model that utilizes real-world hospital survey report data. This effort aligns with broader public health goals of reducing maternal morbidity and mortality associated with postnatal depression and improving the overall well-being of mothers and their families.
**Significance:** The significance of our research is multifaceted. Firstly, it addresses a critical gap in maternal health services by focusing on the postnatal period - a time often characterized by inadequate mental health monitoring. Secondly, our study enriches the literature on mental health risks associated with postnatal depression by providing empirical evidence that can inform more effective healthcare policies and practices. Thirdly, by identifying predictors of suicide attempts, our research highlights the necessity for integrated care approaches that account for the complex interplay of emotional, behavioral, and social factors affecting maternal well-being. Furthermore, this research contributes significantly to understanding the profound impacts of postnatal phase changes on mental health. It clarifies how emotional, behavioral, and interpersonal dynamics contribute to suicide risks, thereby guiding the development of targeted preventative interventions. This study not only advances academic knowledge but also serves as a crucial resource for developing strategies aimed at mitigating the risks associated with postnatal depression.
